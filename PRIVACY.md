# Privacy Policy
TL;DR Quick Message does not, and will never store or share any sensitive data.

## Crash reporting
In the event that Quick Message crashes, your device codename, Android API level, Quick Message version and the crash log itself are sent to Google Play for review. Crash logs do not contain any sensitive information.

## Data Usage
Quick Message does not collect or store any sensitive information with the exception of a single phone number that you (the user) can enter yourself when READ_CONTACTS permission is not granted.
Quick Message stores a lookup key to help it find the contacts you selected, and will fetch that specific contacts name and phone number to be displayed in-app, and is discarded when the app is closed.

## Third-Party Privacy Policies
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any libraries used within Quick Message. Libraries used include, but are not limited to:
